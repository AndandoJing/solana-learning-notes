# Solana Learning Notes

This repository documents my learning and hands-on exploration
during the Solana Developer Training Camp and beyond.

## Focus
- Solana account model and execution constraints
- Program interaction patterns
- On-chain / off-chain system thinking

This repo evolves as I continue learning and building.
