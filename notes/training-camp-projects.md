# Solana Training Camp — Project Notes

This file documents small experiments and exercises completed during
the Solana Developer Training Camp.

## Scope
- Program structure exploration
- Instruction and account handling
- Understanding execution constraints through simple examples

These are learning-oriented exercises rather than production projects,
and serve as groundwork for future hackathons and contributions.
